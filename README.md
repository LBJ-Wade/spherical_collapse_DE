# collapse
Spherical-collapse model code

This code carries out the spherical-collapse calculation for standard cosmological models as well as some dark energy models where the dark energy is homogeneous.

The code compiles with gfortran, and probably with ifort too. It does not need to be linked to any libraries, so you can just '>gfortran collapse.f90' and away you go.
